# Smoke checks

Use this minimal checklist after implementing or updating each screen.

## Screen render
- [ ] Launch the app and navigate to the target screen.
- [ ] Verify the screen renders without errors or blank states.
- [ ] Confirm primary content is visible (title, key components, and main CTA).

## Navigation
- [ ] Navigate to the screen from its entry point (tab, stack, or link).
- [ ] Use the primary action(s) to move to the next screen or flow.
- [ ] Use back navigation to return to the previous screen without crashes.

## Quick sanity
- [ ] Interact with at least one key control (button, list item, or input).
- [ ] Confirm the interaction triggers the expected UI change.
